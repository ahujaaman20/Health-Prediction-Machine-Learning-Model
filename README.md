# Health-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Model
This is First Project of Machine Learning by me

# Documantation
On this repository it is  simple machine learning project.

In machine learning project predict the human health on age, gender and weight, and using a 500 records in **csv** file on this project.

Regarding Data Information are store in ***information.txt*** file.

on this project are testing a multiple regrassion model there example are below
 - LinearRegression model
 - DecisionTreeRegressor model
 - svm model
 - Bayesian Ridge Regression Model
 - SGDRegressor Model
 - Ridge regression Model
 - RandomForestRegressor Model

All Model Error are save into ***Model Error.txt*** File

A final prediction data include predict data through model are store in ***Final Health Data.xlsx*** file
